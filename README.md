# Klickus

A Clickomania clone done in Delphi

Klickus was one of my first hobby projects, which I dared to publish as Open Source. That was in 2003, when I had to deal with Borland Delphi 6.0 as part of my first job. The idea for Klickus came from the game "Klickety", which was delivered as part of the KDE desktop with SuSE Linux. My girlfriend (best regards to Manuela) loved the game, but couldn't play it on her computer running Microsoft Windows. So I rewrote the game in Delphi to her liking.

## The game
        
The rules of the game are easy to understand: The playing field is felled with different coloured blocks. If two or more blocks are directly horizontal or vertical, they can be removed by clicking on one of the blocks. Blocks above fall down. If a column is completely removed from blocks, the remaining columns move from right to left. The aim of the game is to free the playing field from all blocks as quickly as possible.
        
## Hardware requirements

Your hardware should have at least a 233 MHz processor and 32 MB RAM. Weaker systems have not been tested.
